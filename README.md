# Contents of the project!

I'm building different demo elements for a web survey. Inside this project i have different slider examples, a feedback style demo with icons and multi-step questions. Everything that i test out regarding the project goes inside this one website.

← `index.html`: The main web page for the site. Includes links to all demos.
